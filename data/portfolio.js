            desc1: "Rebranding gives companies an opportunity to refresh or completely re-invent their corporate image. Most companies rebrand to modernize an outdated brand, shake a bad reputation, or to appeal to different audiences. Sometimes extensive corporate growth, new management, or the expansion of product lines can trigger the need to rebrand as well.",
            desc2: "In my case, Corporate A Office Equipment decided to rebrand for all of the above, and I found myself in the perfect position to take on the rebrand head first. Starting out, I was given the new company name and a general logo idea to get the ball rolling. Corporate A was a local, family-owned company that had been around for over 60 years. In the next state over, we had acquired Corporate B Business Solutions & Products and Corporate C Office Prodcuts which were also two well-known, family-owned companies - one of which had been established in 1921. My goal was to handle the merger of these 3 well-established companies - along with their differing product lines, create a cohesive brand that could stand the test of time, and finally get the word out while building up a corporate culture to match.",
            desc3: "Given three company names and logos that had absolutely nothing to do with one another, I had my work cut out for me. This new name, 'Z-Tech' was to become the uniting force of these three individual companies. Resistance to changing the identities of these businesses that had been established for nearly 100 years came without a doubt. Many employees were relatives of the previous owners, and some even beared the family name that had been passed down with the businesses throughout the years. It was imperative to many that this new brand encapsulated each of the previous companies and respected the history that had come before them - all while bringing this new company into the 21st century.",

            desc4: "My first task was to announce this new name and establish a connection between the three individual brands. Corporate A, Corporate B, and Corporate C were still operating as three separate companies out of multiple different locations. I had to announce the new name and start tying these brands together. I started out by adding the electric blue 'A Z-Tech Company' tagline under each of the company logos. With red, black, and green logos, the pop of blue that indicated our new brand was eye-catching - seeing as it didn't necessarily mesh well with the other logos, it somewhat worked in our favor that it stood out. People that had recognized these local brands for years could still identify the company they knew, but definitely noticed that something was different.", 
            desc5: "From this point on, every single document, marketing material, email, letterhead, and so on that came out of the company was updated with the sublte electric blue tagline underneath each logo. Since we were still operating three different websites, three different Facebooks, LinkedIns, and Twitter accounts, changes were slowly but surely made to each overall site name as well. After gaining access to all of our accounts, I worked to standardize the brand across all pages so that each about section read the same company story of three brands that were merging together as one. Everyone that had interactions with customers were also briefed and educated on the story we were portraying as this new brand was beginning to come to light.",
            desc6: "After a few months of rolling out the updated logos, internal processes and administrative tasks began merging together and we started running into the 'answering the phone issue'. It became apparent that I needed to work quickly to launch the next phase of our rebrand. The public was starting to ask questions about this new brand and it was becoming increasingly more difficult as our phone lines became intertwined. Calling one number and leaving voicemails for people saying they work at different company names became confusing. People reaching our main line looking for one brand or the other made for quite the hunt to find the correct person to talk to. Sales teams began having to answer the phone as 'Hi, you've reached 'Corporate A Office Equipment, Corporate B Business Solutions & Products, Corporate C Office Prodcuts, A Z-Tech Company', how may I help you?' and 99% of the time, they couldn't utter out the combined company name fast enough to beat a 30 second voicemail. This was no way to go on for very long so the next phase ensued - ",

            desc1: "From 2015 to 2017, I worked as a “Client Relations Intern” at a software development company – essentially marketing, client-facing project management, recruitment, event planning, all of the “social” tasks that the developers tended to steer clear of. It was a company of 18 developers (all men) and 3 client relationship managers (all women), which meant “all company meetings” were pretty typical. You start out the first 10 minutes of the meeting with the 3 client relationship managers going over the list of customer requests, bugs, custom features, etc., and then spend the last 50 minutes going over who’s going to implement what code and how the developers are going to technically handle each request.",
            desc2: "After sitting through a handful of these meetings and usually zoning out through the technical jargon, I decided to take this as an opportunity to learn. I would ask questions and try to really understand what the developers were talking about. Most of the time, I would get the “dumbed-down” version of how their code worked, and a handful of times I’d get the shrug off of “oh you just wouldn’t get it”. This added fuel to the fire. Never again would I sit in a room where I just wouldn’t understand and not do anything about it.", 
            desc3: "I started out with Code Academy taking HTML & CSS Basics, and really started paying attention to the terminology used in each meeting. I ended up on the website re-development team to make contributions toward design suggestions, content, and brand consistency. As the developers handled the bulk of the site, I’d update things through a WordPress interface while messing around with the HTML editor and CSS stylesheets from time to time. I still remember the first time I changed the color of an element on the website and things just started to click. I was so excited that I could finally start contributing more than just telling the developers what I wanted. From there, I took it upon myself to continue learning more about code and began building Wordpress sites for friends and family. While working full time in 2018, I received a Full Stack Web Development Certification from Northwestern University, and have continued to expand on this education as a lifelong learner.",
