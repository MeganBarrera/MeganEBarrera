BLOG-TITLE: New Name, Who's This? - Rebranding Under A New Name
TOPIC: Brand Management
DATE: Nov 11, 2019
DESC: Rebranding gives companies an opportunity to refresh or completely re-invent their corporate image. Most companies rebrand to modernize
an outdated brand, shake a bad reputation, or to appeal to different audiences. Sometimes extensive corporate growth, new management, or the 
expansion of product lines can trigger the need to rebrand as well.

In my case, Corporate A decided to rebrand for all of the above, and I found myself in the perfect position to take on the rebrand head first.
Starting out, I was given the new company name and a general logo idea to get the ball rolling. Corporate A was a local, family-owned 
company that head been around for over 60 years. In the next state over, we had acquired Corporate B and Corporate C which were also two well-known, 
family-owned companies - one of which had been established in 1921. My goal was to handle the merger of these 3 well-established companies - along 
with their differing product lines, create a cohesive brand that could stand the test of time, and finally get the word out while building up a 
corporate culture to match.

Given three company names and logos that had absolutely nothing to do with one another, I had my work cut out for me. This new name, "Z-Tech" was to 
become the uniting force of these three individual companies.
